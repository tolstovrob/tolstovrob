In addition to my studies, I also enjoy teaching and sharing my expertise with others as member of [Developer Student Clubs](https://dsc.alivetech.org). I deliver lectures and work on courses, mainly focused on frontend development. 

At my free time, I enjoy playing chess, which helps me develop strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. I also play OTB tournaments from time to time: [my RCF rating](https://ratings.ruchess.ru/people/660811).
