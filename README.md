### 👋 Hey there!

Hello! My name is Robert, and I am a web developer and software engineer with a keen interest in solving complex problems, which drives me to continually improve my skills and knowledge.

Currently I specialize in frontend development, primarily working with TypeScript, Next.js and SvelteKit to build modern interfaces and implement architectural patterns.

### 🙃 Side Quests

In addition to my studies, I also enjoy teaching and sharing my expertise with others as a member of the [Developer Student Clubs](https://dsc.alivetech.org) at SSU. I deliver lectures and develop courses primarily focused on frontend development. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, which helps me develop strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. I also compete in over-the-board chess tournaments from time to time; here is my official [RCF rating](https://ratings.ruchess.ru/people/660811).
